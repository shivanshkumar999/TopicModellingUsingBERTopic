              " \"Rental car damage is a concern for both car rental companies and for customers. The former, of course, want to be sure that their vehicles are returned as intact as possible, so they can be quickly deployed for the next customer. Customers have their own concerns—like being charged for damage they did not cause. On the other hand, some customers who damage rental vehicles try to cover up that damage. It's a tug of war—and makes for an unpleasant experience for everyone.\",\n",
              " 'But technology to the rescue: Using digital tools, augmented reality, computer vision technology, artificial intelligence and automation, customers can be assured of a fair bill when they return a vehicle and companies can make sure they are treating customers fairly and honestly. This technology, in fact, enables companies to set up contactless returns—where customers simply drop off vehicles and are immediately informed about charges for damage, if any—payable either by them or insurance companies. Perhaps even more importantly, it brings us closer to eliminating uncertainty about whether or not damage occurred during a rental agreement or not.',\n",
              " 'The key to this industry innovation is the deployment of an automated inspection technology that utilizes advanced vision, scanning vehicles when they are rented out and when they are returned. The images taken upon return are compared to the images of the vehicle taken before it was rented. Any major damage or large scratches will of course be visible immediately—but using AI, you can scan any part of the vehicle to determine if it was in any kind of an accident or sustained even minor exterior damage of any kind—on body panels, trim parts, wheels, bumpers or roof.',\n",
              " 'A detailed and itemized list of the damages and the costs to repair each creates a clear and objective record of not only who is responsible, but for what, exactly, they are responsible and how much it will cost to remedy. These costs can also be determined by advanced data-analysis which considers the costs of such repairs in real time, based on market prices.',\n",
              " \"Images could be taken by stationary cameras at a return facility at the agency—at a special airport dropoff point, for example. But with today's sophisticated smartphones—which feature advanced cameras—customers could also simply snap photos of the vehicle and upload them to the rental agency's servers, where the analysis would take place. Augmented reality could help guide the user to scan the car correctly and capture the best images. Thus the customer would save even more time—just dropping off the vehicle without having to wait even the few minutes it would take to analyze the vehicle's images at the dropoff point. That dropoff option could enable painless, quick dropoffs 24/7.\",\n",
              " \"Advanced image analysis isn't just about better customer relations; it can help agencies in other ways. With business dropping to near-zero levels at the beginning of the pandemic, companies sold off much of their fleets in 2020 and 2021, expecting to buy new vehicles when things rebounded. But supply chain issues put a dent in vehicle manufacturing—and when trying to restock, companies faced the same shortages everyone else did. But with demand rising again, companies did the next best thing—keeping their older vehicles and servicing them instead of selling them off as they had in the past.\",\n",
              " \"As a result, many rental vehicles on the road have experienced considerable wear and tear—and companies that want to ensure that their customers have a nice vehicle and don't break down in the middle of nowhere need to do a very thorough analysis of all parts of the car, including the exterior, thus ensuring the vehicle's physical integrity when it's on the road. Using this technology, however, drivers can do an inspection “check-in” on a regular basis, with the data uploaded to the agency, which can remain assured that its vehicle is still roadworthy. With these inspection systems, drivers can also return rentals in a quick contactless manner.\",\n",
              " 'Adopting advanced car inspection systems heralds a new era of efficiency and customer service for car rental companies. Before diving into this technological evolution, there are key considerations that potential adopters should be cognizant of:',\n",
              " \"1. Holistic Integration: Understand that this isn't just a plug-and-play solution. It's a holistic transition that encompasses infrastructure revamp, updated training modules and potentially redefined customer service protocols. A successful transition requires a multifaceted approach.\",\n",
              " \"2. Comprehensive Training: The tech, while sophisticated, is user-friendly with the right training. It’s paramount that both managerial and frontline staff undergo comprehensive sessions to become well-versed with the system's full capabilities. This ensures not only smooth internal operations but also consistent customer interactions.\",\n",
              " '3. Setting Clear Expectations: Clear communication with customers about the new inspection process ensures transparency and trust. Highlight the benefits, such as expedited returns and accurate damage assessments, so they appreciate the value added by this technology.',\n",
              " \"4. Pilot Programs: Before a full-scale rollout, consider running pilot programs at select locations. This allows for real-world testing, helps in identifying areas of improvement and builds internal confidence in the system's efficacy.\",\n",
              " '5. Continuous Feedback: Encourage feedback, both from staff and customers. This iterative feedback loop ensures the system is always optimized and meets the evolving needs of the business and its clientele.',\n",
              " 'In essence, while the advanced car inspection system promises a transformative leap, its success lies in thorough preparation, effective communication and a commitment to continuous learning and improvement.',\n",
              " \"And while some may mourn the loss of “personal touch” with automated inspection, the reality is that customers actually prefer it. Industry experts see contactless self-service commerce as a “new reality” not just for inspections—but for all aspects of rental, from pickup to drop off to payment. The benefits to both the customer and the rental agency are clear—and it's just a matter of time before contactless inspections become the norm, not the exception.\",\n",

Technics has included all these features with the EAH-AZ40M2 in a compact form factor at a slightly lower price than the other two models in the Technics lineup.',\n",
              " 'The 6mm dynamic driver in the EAH-AZ40M2 earbuds delivers a clear sound with plenty of width in the soundstage and a slightly lighter bass than the company’s flagship EAH-AZ80 earbuds. That’s not a criticism because what the EAH-AZ40M2 lacks in the bottom end, it more than makes up for in the midrange and treble.',\n",
              " 'To achieve the detailed sound of the EAH-AZ40M2, Technics has fashioned an acoustic control chamber in each earpiece that optimizes the airflow to provide natural-sounding vocals and other mid-ranges. And it does that perfectly.',\n",

              " 'The bass on these earbuds can be heard rather than felt. That is down to the smaller 6mm dynamic drivers used in the EAH-AZ40M2. The treble frequencies focus the sound brilliantly and with minimal discernible distortion. The overall effect is an immersive and satisfying presentation that coaxes all the details from a recording, revealing loads of detail without taxing the ears.',\n",
              " 'The EAH-AZ40M2 improves on its predecessor, the EAH-AZ40, with the addition of ANC technology. A software-based digital filter coupled with a feedforward microphone does an excellent job suppressing unwanted sounds from outside. The efficiency of the ANC isn’t quite up there with the best over-the-ear ANC headphones, but I think Technics has earbud ANC cracked and delivers excellent noise canceling levels.',\n",

For example, you could listen to music on your personal phone when a business call comes on your work phone. With Multipoint Connectivity, you can switch seamlessly to your work phone and take the phone call. With three-way Multipoint you can even have your laptop connected and switch seamlessly to that for a Zoom call. The EAH-AZ40M2 earbuds support the SBC and AAC audio codecs, but there’s no support for higher resolution codecs such as aptX or LDAC.',\n",

Beamforming technology makes for clearer phone calls and less distraction from background sounds.',\n",
              " 'Most of us listen to our earbuds in stereo, but the Technics EAH-AZ40M2 can also be used in single earbud mode, leaving one ear free to pick up ambient sound. Single-earbud use is ideal if you are interviewing someone next to you on a video call and need to hear both the online feed and what your interviewee is saying.',\n",

Natural Ambient Mode feeds all the surrounding sounds to your ears so you can listen to music or make a phone call while still hearing all that’s happening around you. The Attention Mode captures sounds that lie within the range of the human voice so that you can listen to people talking nearby while cutting out unwanted external noises.',\n",

With the reserve charge stored in the charging case, there are 25 hours of backup power, more than enough for two return flights across the Atlantic. With ANC turned on, the earbuds will play for up to 5.5 hours, while the charging case provides 18 hours of ANC operation. There’s no wireless charging with these earbuds, so you’ll have to use the USB-C cable supplied.',\n",
              " 'The Technics Audio Connect smartphone app offers many opportunities to customize the EAH-AZ40M2 earbuds. That includes support for voice assistants and tweaking the earbud EQ with a custom equalizer and preset tones. Regarding weather resistance, the EAH-AZ40M2 are water resistant to IPX4, which means the earbuds can withstand splashes of liquid but won’t survive a dip in the pool.',\n",

They ship with silicone earpieces in five sizes so you can achieve an efficient acoustic seal. It’s worth playing around with the different tip sizes, as the fit greatly affects the sound quality and comfort levels.',\n",
              " 'Verdict: The Technics EAH-AZ40M2 True Wireless ANC earbuds are almost as good as the more expensive EAH-AZ80 and EAH-AZ60M2. The only difference to my ears is a slightly lighter bass response, a smaller and lighter design, plus the absence of any hi-res audio codecs, which is surprising considering the price. The sound created by the EAH-AZ40M2 is wonderfully clear, with plenty of presence in the midrange and a perfectly smooth treble. These qualities make them ideal for opera, classical and acoustic music. If you want ear-splitting bass, then the EAH-AZ40M2 might not cut it for you, but for the money, they are solid performers and well worth a listen.',\n",

The USA’s is currently US$51, but the Environmental Protection Agency and Canada recently aligned their methodologies, so the EPA is proposing raising it to US$190. Australia hasn’t adopted a national social cost of carbon, but its national capital territory (roughly equivalent to Washington, DC) has chosen a cost per ton of US$13.',\n",
              " 'The “carbon” part of the term is also a clue to the challenges. Carbon dioxide is the primary greenhouse gas we’ve been emitting globally for a long time, but it’s far from the only one. Natural gas is mostly methane which is a much more potent but shorter lived greenhouse gas. Most of the refrigerants in our air conditioners, heat pumps and freezers are greenhouse gases, and while they are much lower in absolutely quantities, they are almost all thousands of times more potent and also persist a long time in the atmosphere. Nitrous oxides which form when ammonia fertilizers are used among other sources is also a potent greenhouse gas.',\n",

Which of the heavily lobbied and hence very conservative IPCC warming and impact scenarios should be considered as the baseline? The complexities of drawing the right boundaries and the importance to very rich organizations and individuals in numerous countries of not getting to end of job means that we have spent far too long figuring out what the numbers should be.',\n",
              " 'Let’s return to the actual carbon prices that have been implemented as a comparison to the social cost. Canada has a reasonable carbon pricing program, one which steadily increases and allows its provinces to choose their own approach as long as they match the cost and benefits. The carbon price is currently US$48, and it’s a greenhouse gas price, so it includes methane and refrigerants.',\n",
              " 'Sharp eyes will note that it’s about a quarter of the social cost of carbon. By 2030, it will be US$126 but the social cost of carbon will be US$219, still a lot higher. California’s cap and trade system, which eleven US states and two Canadian provinces are part of, is only at US$36. China’s new cap and trade system is pricing carbon at US$10 per ton, and still excludes more goods and services than more mature systems.',\n",
              " 'And that’s the next problem. Political will to implement carbon pricing is low in the majority of countries in the world, although given California, Europe, China and Canada’s involvement as major economies, the World Bank estimates that 23% of greenhouse gas emissions are currently at least covered under a carbon price, if not an adequate one.',\n",

One was brought forward under the current administration as an anti-China carbon border adjustment mechanism that incidentally applied to all domestic economic activities, but it didn’t even make it to a vote. Australia had a carbon price, but the right-wing coalition that took power a decade ago campaigned on eliminating it, and proceeded to quickly fulfill that regressive promise.',\n",
              " 'However, the USA’s failure was interesting because of the “border adjustment” part of it. That’s a carbon price that applies to imports, in part to ensure that domestic goods and services aren’t rendered uncompetitive against high-carbon foreign competitors. While the USA was unable to garner sufficient support even inside the Democratic Party for the measure, the European Union is moving forward with one.',\n",
              " 'The EU is the third largest economy on the planet. It’s a major trading partner with virtually every country in the world. Everyone exporting to it now has to report on the carbon embodied in their products, and in 2026 they are required to pay the same amount as a European firm would under the emissions trading scheme. The ETS is currently pricing carbon at about US$88 per ton and peaked at US$107 this year. It’s expected to maintain and increase its price.',\n",
              " 'The ETS has historically excluded non-carbon greenhouse gases, but it’s including methane and nitrous oxide as of 2026 as well. It’s one of the most inclusive, highest-priced carbon pricing approaches in the world. And now everyone who exports to the EU will be paying it. That said, the current price is still less than half of the social cost of carbon.',\n",

              " 'Non-technical managers and employees “shouldn’t break their heads over developing technical skills, but I would suggest that they learn the basics so they can find, hire, communicate, and manage and direct their technical leads with a sharp awareness.” They should still “learn the basics of code, language models, and neural networks so they can learn the universal language of programming — the more AI we introduce into our daily processes, the more we will need to partner with AI to ensure our solutions,” Eden says.',\n",

            "but technology to the rescue: using digital tools augmented reality computer vision technology artificial intelligence and automation customers can be assured of a fair bill when they return a vehicle and companies can make sure they are treating customers fairly and honestly. this technology in fact enables companies to set up contactless returns—where customers simply drop off vehicles and are immediately informed about charges for damage if any—payable either by them or insurance companies. perhaps even more importantly it brings us closer to eliminating uncertainty about whether or not damage occurred during a rental agreement or not.\n",
            "the key to this industry innovation is the deployment of an automated inspection technology that utilizes advanced vision scanning vehicles when they are rented out and when they are returned. the images taken upon return are compared to the images of the vehicle taken before it was rented. any major damage or large scratches will of course be visible immediately—but using ai you can scan any part of the vehicle to determine if it was in any kind of an accident or sustained even minor exterior damage of any kind—on body panels trim parts wheels bumpers or roof.\n",
            "images could be taken by stationary cameras at a return facility at the agency—at a special airport dropoff point for example. but with today's sophisticated smartphones—which feature advanced cameras—customers could also simply snap photos of the vehicle and upload them to the rental agency's servers where the analysis would take place. augmented reality could help guide the user to scan the car correctly and capture the best images. thus the customer would save even more time—just dropping off the vehicle without having to wait even the few minutes it would take to analyze the vehicle's images at the dropoff point. that dropoff option could enable painless quick dropoffs 24/7.\n",
            "advanced image analysis isn't just about better customer relations; it can help agencies in other ways. with business dropping to near-zero levels at the beginning of the pandemic companies sold off much of their fleets in 2020 and 2021 expecting to buy new vehicles when things rebounded. but supply chain issues put a dent in vehicle manufacturing—and when trying to restock companies faced the same shortages everyone else did. but with demand rising again companies did the next best thing—keeping their older vehicles and servicing them instead of selling them off as they had in the past.\n",
            "as a result many rental vehicles on the road have experienced considerable wear and tear—and companies that want to ensure that their customers have a nice vehicle and don't break down in the middle of nowhere need to do a very thorough analysis of all parts of the car including the exterior thus ensuring the vehicle's physical integrity when it's on the road. using this technology however drivers can do an inspection “check-in” on a regular basis with the data uploaded to the agency which can remain assured that its vehicle is still roadworthy. with these inspection systems drivers can also return rentals in a quick contactless manner.\n",
            "technics is one of the first earbuds to support three-way multipoint connectivity. for example you could listen to music on your personal phone when a business call comes on your work phone. with multipoint connectivity you can switch seamlessly to your work phone and take the phone call. with three-way multipoint you can even have your laptop connected and switch seamlessly to that for a zoom call. the eah-az40m2 earbuds support the sbc and aac audio codecs but there’s no support for higher resolution codecs such as aptx or ldac.\n",
            "verdict: the technics eah-az40m2 true wireless anc earbuds are almost as good as the more expensive eah-az80 and eah-az60m2. the only difference to my ears is a slightly lighter bass response a smaller and lighter design plus the absence of any hi-res audio codecs which is surprising considering the price. the sound created by the eah-az40m2 is wonderfully clear with plenty of presence in the midrange and a perfectly smooth treble. these qualities make them ideal for opera classical and acoustic music. if you want ear-splitting bass then the eah-az40m2 might not cut it for you but for the money they are solid performers and well worth a listen.\n",
            "it is our stance at the i/o fund that the stock market is not logical rather it’s sentimental. there is no logical explanation for a stock to go up 100% or more —— only to fall 40% or more in the matter of a couple of months. fundamentals do not change this quickly but sentiment does. in the simplest terms sentiment is driven by how fear and greed interrelate with supply and demand. however the way to track sentiment to protect capital is much more complex and needs to combine fundamental analysis with technical analysis\n",
            "we’ve had unwavering conviction in nvidia’s ai story since november of 2018. in fact it was our leading position going into 2023 and our ai allocation of 45% exceeded stanley druckenmiller at 29% meanwhile druckenmiller was celebrated for having a leading ai portfolio. the street is also taking credit for being early to nvidia which was a latecomer recommendation in march of 2023. ark often discusses ai as a leading trend yet almost missed this ai leader entirely. we point this out because we provided nvidia as a stock tip for free repeatedly with top tier analysis delivered on forbes and through our free newsletter with our own capital backing the research.\n",
            "nvidia is a core holding of ours so we will likely never close the position as long as the story and tech trend remain intact. however we do strongly believe in taking gains reducing risk and targeting lower levels for a better cost basis. that being said we believe we are approaching one of these moments. even though we broke a key trendline today we expect a bounce to occur soon. if this bounce is a corrective bounce that fails to reclaim key overhead levels we will trim our position even more.\n",
            "the logic for applying them to the negative externalities of greenhouse gas emissions is clear aligned with conservative economic principles as well as the market economics of the vast majority of the world and has an excellent history of precedents to draw upon. this is of course why the large greenhouse gas emitters tend to fight tooth and nail against pricing carbon. it’s also why purportedly economically conservative politicians are bending over backward to pretend that a conservative economic policy is actually not fiscally conservative in many parts of the world.\n",
            "“generally accepted definition” is the next part of the problem. most major countries have developed their own definition including what should be included and exclude and what process and quality controls are applied to the cost. that’s changing as countries align their definitions. canada’s current social cost of carbon is us194. the usa’s is currently us51 but the environmental protection agency and canada recently aligned their methodologies so the epa is proposing raising it to us190. australia hasn’t adopted a national social cost of carbon but its national capital territory (roughly equivalent to washington dc) has chosen a cost per ton of us13.\n",
            "the “carbon” part of the term is also a clue to the challenges. carbon dioxide is the primary greenhouse gas we’ve been emitting globally for a long time but it’s far from the only one. natural gas is mostly methane which is a much more potent but shorter lived greenhouse gas. most of the refrigerants in our air conditioners heat pumps and freezers are greenhouse gases and while they are much lower in absolutely quantities they are almost all thousands of times more potent and also persist a long time in the atmosphere. nitrous oxides which form when ammonia fertilizers are used among other sources is also a potent greenhouse gas.\n",
            "importantly managers of today and tomorrow need to understand the implications of ai on the career aspirations of their team members. “every working professional will eventually be impacted by ai” eden predicts. fields that will be augmented by ai include those “that analyze and aggregate massive data” she continues. examples include data analytics actuaries seo specialists marketing professionals legal teams contract managers and trading desks. “ai will be able to track follow and predict certain trends that the human mind and eye takes too long to do.”\n",
            "managers won’t have to have algorithm development skills but will be expected to have a high-level understanding of the implications of ai to their operations and organizations. \"ai is challenging professionals across all occupations to redirect their skills to be more adaptive analytical data-driven and cross disciplinary\" says joe robinson co-founder and ceo of hummingbird. \"they must be up to date on the latest trends from multiple angles – business legal privacy information security and so on. for example how is ai being implemented what are the capabilities and limitations of ai and what are the regulations that are currently being put in place? only with this knowledge can professionals and managers assess when and where to apply ai.\"\n"
